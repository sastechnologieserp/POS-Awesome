/**
 * Public barrel for the POS offline layer.
 *
 * Import all offline functionality from this module rather than from individual
 * sub-modules. The layer is composed of four levels:
 *
 * - **`db`** — storage primitives: the Dexie IndexedDB instance (`db`), the
 *   in-memory store (`memory`), batched `persist()`, network-status helpers, and
 *   cache-clear utilities. Every other sub-module in this layer depends on these.
 *
 * - **Domain queues** (`invoices`, `customers`, `payments`, `cash_movements`,
 *   `stock`) — per-domain read/write helpers for data queued while the device is
 *   offline and replayed to the server when connectivity is restored.
 *
 * - **`cache`** — named key-value accessors for reference data fetched from the
 *   server (offers, price lists, exchange rates, item details, etc.). Every write
 *   goes through `memory` and calls `persist()`.
 *
 * - **`sync/*`** — background sync engine composed of `types`, `resourceRegistry`,
 *   `syncState`, `SyncCoordinator`, `useSyncCoordinator`, and per-resource
 *   `adapters`.
 *
 * `startupInitPromise` covers only boot-critical state. `memoryInitPromise` is a
 * backward-compatible alias for the full `initPromise`; await it before reading
 * non-critical `memory` values.
